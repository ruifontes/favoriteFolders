## Presentation
Records the user's most used folders.

It can be used from anywhere.
If activated from the File Explorer, the "Add folder" button will be available to add the current folder if it's not already in the list.
During the registration process, the folder's name is suggested, but it can be changed.
To open a registered folder, simply press Enter on it or activate the "Open folder" button.
The name of a folder can be changed by activating the "Rename" button.
To remove a folder from the registry, press Delete on it or click the "Remove" button.
If the add-on is activated from an editing field, the "Write in the editing field" button will be available.
When activated, the cursor will move to the beginning of the line, and then the folder path will be inserted.
This is very useful in file save or open dialogs.


## Important
Some folders, such as Documents or Downloads, may not display the default path in the address bar when opened through shortcuts.
To add them, it is necessary to open them by pressing Enter on them.
Inserting the path does not work in editing fields like Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft Outlook, etc., but only in the open and save dialogs.


## Command
WINDOWS+BACKSPACE - Opens the add-on dialog.
